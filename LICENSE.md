**FNV hash algorithms and source code have been released into the public domain.**

---

 The authors of the FNV algorithm took deliberate steps to disclose the algorithm in a public forum soon after it was invented. More than a year passed after this public disclosure and the authors deliberately took no steps to patent the FNV algorithm. Therefore it is safe to say that the FNV authors have no patent claims on the FNV algorithm as published.
